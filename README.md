##### Abstract
The project aims to provide a comprehensive and interactive visual representation of subsurface geology by creating three-dimensional images of seismic volumes in **MayaVI** library. The project will facilitate a better understanding of subsurface geology by allowing users to interact with the data in a more intuitive and efficient manner utilizing **TraitsUI** library. Visualization of seismic volumes is a very crucial component of interpretation workflows, be it to pick salt domes, interpret horizons, identify fault planes, or classify rock facies.

##### Outline

The project will involve the following steps:

- Collecting seismic data and processing it to generate seismic volumes.
- Converting the seismic volumes into 3D models (numpy arrays) using a specialized python module *segyio*.
- Developing an interactive user interface that allows the user to visualize and manipulate the 3D models, using **TraitsUI**.
- Adding functionalities for analysis using *matplotlib* and **mayaVI** to be able to identify fault planes, classification of rock structures, etc.
- Adding features such as colouring, slicing, and annotation to enhance the interpretability of the data.
- Experiments with popular datasets and demonstration of results of our application corresponding to multiple use cases.
